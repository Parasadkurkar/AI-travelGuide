## ✨ Core Features

* **🤖 AI-Powered Itinerary Builder:** Users can input a destination, duration, and personal interests to receive a custom, day-by-day travel plan generated by Google's Gemini AI.
* **☀️ Live Weather Integration:** After generating an itinerary, the app automatically fetches and displays the current weather for the destination using the OpenWeatherMap API.
* **🎡 Dynamic "Coverflow" Suggestions:** The "Suggested Trips" page features a modern, auto-playing "Coverflow" slider (built with Swiper.js) to showcase inspiring destinations.
* **🛡️ Robust API Fallback System:** The suggestions page first tries to fetch live data from a third-party travel API. If the API fails or the quota is exceeded, it *automatically* falls back to a curated list of trips from its own MongoDB database, ensuring the app never breaks.
* **💎 Modern "Glassmorphism" UI:** The entire application features a custom UI with an animated gradient background and "frosted glass" card effects for a unique, polished feel.
